h1. Welcome to the %{color:blue}AtectBase% project !


The aim of this project is to create a *database* that:
* can contain hierarchical structured object data
* automatically manages cascaded copy and delete
* can store calculation terms in a natural way like a spreadsheet, calculation terms 
   can use fields of different objects and results get automatically updated
* allows UNDO / REDO as a database feature
* has high reliability in storing data and keeping the network connections
* has multi user facilities to allow a group of people use the same data at the same time
* automatically notifies clients about commited data changes, so there are live updates
* provides an easy programming model to build vertical applications on top
