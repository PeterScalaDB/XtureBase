h1. Welcome to the %{color:blue}XtureBase% project !


The aim of this project is to create a *database* that:
* can contain hierarchical structured object data
* automatically manages cascaded copy and delete
* can store calculation terms in a natural way like a spreadsheet, calculation terms 
   can use fields of different objects and results get automatically updated
* allows UNDO / REDO as a database feature
* has high reliability in storing data and keeping the network connections
* has multi user facilities to allow a group of people use the same data at the same time
* automatically notifies clients about commited data changes, so there are live updates
* provides an easy programming model to build vertical applications on top

The short term goal  to create the basic database function is archived.

At the moment the development is about the spatial description of the building structure.

* current state: A simple 3D editor for planes and volumes is finished. 

The long term objective is to create an architectural tool for "Building Information Modelling":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling (BIM), where all graphical and textual information about a building can be managed in one multifunctional database.

The database is written in the language "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/
