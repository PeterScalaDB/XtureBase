h1. Welcome to the %{color:blue}XtureBase% project !


The aim of this project is to create a *database* that:
* can contain hierarchical structured object data
* automatically manages cascaded copy and delete
* can store calculation terms in a natural way like a spreadsheet, calculation terms 
   can use fields of different objects and results get automatically updated
* allows UNDO / REDO as a database feature
* has high reliability in storing data and keeping the network connections
* has multi user facilities to allow a group of people use the same data at the same time
* automatically notifies clients about commited data changes, so there are live updates
* provides an easy programming model to build vertical applications on top

My short term goal is to create a simple 2d graphical editor, to test the database and UI concept
The long term objective is to create a multifunctional database to describe a building in a graphical and textual way and store all related data in one place

The database is written in "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/
