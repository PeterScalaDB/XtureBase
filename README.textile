h1. Welcome to the %{color:blue}XtureBase% project !


The aim of this project is to create a *database* that:
* can contain hierarchical structured object data
* automatically manages cascaded copy and delete
* can store calculation terms in a natural way like a spreadsheet, calculation terms 
   can use fields of different objects and results get automatically updated
* allows UNDO / REDO as a database feature
* has high reliability in storing data and keeping the network connections
* has multi user facilities to allow a group of people use the same data at the same time
* automatically notifies clients about commited data changes, so there are live updates
* provides an easy programming model to build vertical applications on top

My short term goal is to create a simple 2d graphical editor, to test the database and UI concept.
* current state: with the sample data structure it is possible to read in 2D DXF files and 
store lines as database elements. The drawings can be displayed on screen and distributed 
over network. Yeah !

The long term objective is to create a multifunctional database to describe a building in a graphical and textual way and store all related data in one place

The database is written in "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/
